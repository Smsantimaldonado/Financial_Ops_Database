# Financial operations database

This repository is a collection of files that I used in a side project

This project is an 'app' where I can register the investment operations that I did:
I can register the following data:
 - Operation date: Date of the investment
 - Type of operation: buy / sell / funding the account / withdraw funds / dividend collection
 - Currency of operation: ARS (argentinian peso) o USD (US dollar)
 - Class: Equity / Bonds (goverment debt) / ONs (corporative debt) 
 - Payment term: CI (inmediately) / 24hs (24 hours after operation) / 48hs (48 hours after operation)
 - Price: Gross price of the operation
 - Quantity: Units traded
 - Fx: Foreign exchange rate ARS/USD
 - DmIVA: Commision and taxes applied to the operation
 - Liquidation date: Date of money deposit - directly related to payment term and date of investment
 - Net price: directly related to gross price and commision and taxes
 - Ticker
